<h2>About</h2>

<p>
  Ccache is (since 2010) developed and maintained by
  <a href="https://github.com/jrosdahl/">Joel Rosdahl</a>. It was originally
  written by <a href="https://www.samba.org/~tridge/">Andrew

<blockquote>
<p>ccache was inspired by the compilercache shell script written by Erik Thiele
and I would like to thank him for an excellent piece of work. See
<a href="http://www.erikyyy.de/compilercache/">
http://www.erikyyy.de/compilercache/</a> for Erik's scripts.</p>

<p>I wrote ccache because I wanted to get a bit more speed out of a compiler
cache and I wanted to remove some of the limitations of the shell-script
version.
